	//In the binary representation, the least significant 1-bit in n always corresponds to a 0-bit in n - 1. Therefore, anding the two numbers n and n - 1 always flips the least significant 1-bit in n to 0, and keeps all other bits the same.

	//The solution is straight-forward. We check each of the 32 bits of the number. If the bit is 1, we add one to the number of 1-bits.
    //We can check the i^{th} bit of a number using a bit mask. We start with a mask m=1, because the binary representation of 1 is,
    //0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000100000000000000000000000000000001 Clearly, a logical AND between any number and the mask 1 gives us the least significant bit of this number. To check the next bit, we shift the mask to the left by one.
